# Binary_search

Binary Search : In computer science, a binary search or half-interval search algorithm finds the position of a target value within a sorted array. 

The binary search algorithm can be classified as a dichotomies divide-and-conquer search algorithm and executes in logarithmic time.



## Binary Search Complexity
### Time Complexities
- Best case complexity: O(1)
- Average case complexity: O(log n)
- Worst case complexity: O(log n)

 ### Space Complexity
- The space complexity of the binary search is O(1).
